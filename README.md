## About

The Work Day Scheduler is designed to make a user-friendly, daily work planner. The user will be able to view the hours of a typical business day at a glance, and see what events are scheduled for what time. A color coded interface allows the user to easily track the past, current, and future times and events listed. Events can be added and saved by the user, and will populate the next time the app is used.

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
