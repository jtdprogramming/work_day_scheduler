## About
The Work Day Scheduler app is designed to make a user friendly, editable, daily planner. The user will be able to view the day at a glance and see what
events are scheduled for what time. A color coded interface allows the user to easily track the time and events listed. Events can be added by the user and will populate the next time the app is used.
