## About

The Work Day Scheduler is designed to make a user-friendly, daily work planner. The user will be able to view the hours of a typical business day at a glance, and see what events are scheduled for what time. A color coded interface allows the user to instantly track the past, current, and future times and events listed. Events can be added and saved by the user, and will populate the next time the app is used.
